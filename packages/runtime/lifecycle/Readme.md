# Description

The Marlowe Lifecycle package contains code to query, create and interact with the Marlowe Contracts associated with a given wallet. In other words, it let you interact with "your" contracts.

The main exported type is the {@link api.RuntimeLifecycle} API which can be constructed {@link index | from a wallet API instance } or {@link browser | using a wallet name in the browser}.
