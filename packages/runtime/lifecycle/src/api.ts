  /**
   * Role Token Configuration for the new contract passed in the `contract` field.
   *
   * <h4>Participants</h4>
   * <p>
   * Participants ({@link @marlowe.io/language-core-v1!index.Party | Party}) in a Marlowe Contract can be expressed in 2 ways:
   *
   *  1. **By Adressses** : When an address is fixed in the contract we don't need to provide further configuration.
   *  2. **By Roles** : When the participation is done through a Role Token, we need to define if that token is minted as part of the contract creation transaction or if it was minted beforehand.
   *
   * </p>
   *
   * <h4>Configuration Options</h4>
   * <p>
   *
   * - **When to create (mint)**
   *   - **Within the Runtime** : At the contrat creation, these defined Roles Tokens will be minted "on the fly" by the runtime.
   *   - **Without the Runtime** : before the creation, these Role Tokens are already defined (via an NFT platform, `cardano-cli`, another Marlowe Contract Created, etc.. )
   * - **How to distribute**
   *   - **Closedly** (Closed Roles) : At the creation of contract or before, the Role Tokens are released to the participants. All the participants are known at the creation and therefore we consider the participation as being closed.
   *   - **Openly** (Open Roles) : Whoever applies an input (IDeposit or IChoice) on the contract `contract` first will be identified as a participant by receiving the Role Token in their wallet. In that case, participants are unknown at the creation and the participation is open to any meeting the criteria.
   * - **With or without Metadata**
   * - **Quantities to create(Mint)** : When asking to mint the tokens within the Runtime, quantities can defined as well.
   *
   * Smart Constructors are available to ease these configuration:
   *    - {@link @marlowe.io/runtime-rest-client!contract.useMintedRoles}
   *    - {@link @marlowe.io/runtime-rest-client!contract.mintRole}
   *
   * @remarks
   *  - The Distribution can be a mix of Closed and Open Role Tokens configuration. See examples below.
   * </p>

   *
   * ```ts

   * <p>
   * Metadata can be expressed as a JSON object with some restrictions:
   *   - All top-level keys must be integers between 0 and 2^63 - 1.
   *   - Each metadata value is tagged with its type.
   *   - Strings must be at most 64 characters long (64 bytes) when UTF-8 is encoded.
   *   - Bytestrings are hex-encoded, with a maximum length of 64 bytes.
   *
   * Metadata aren't stored as JSON on the Cardano blockchain but are instead stored using a compact binary encoding (CBOR).
   * The binary encoding of metadata values supports three simple types:
   *    - Integers in the range `-(2^63 - 1)` to `2^63 - 1`
   *    - Strings (UTF-8 encoded)
   *    - Bytestrings
